## [What is the best programming language for beginners?](#best-prog-lang)

OK, you decided to learn how to program. You probably have tons of questions.. How should I start, from what should I start, Which programming language should I pickup???

> When I started programming, we didn't have any of these sissy high level languages. All we had were zeros and ones - And some times we didn't even have ones... _- One Old Programmer_

Nowadays there are a lot of programming languages and it is really hard to figure out which language choose to start learning.
Each programming language helps us to achieve certain goals.
e.g.:
- [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) - working with database; 
- [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) -  for client/server web applications
- [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) - wide spectre from OS to Microcontrollers
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - for web pages, server web applications and even video games ([browser quest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/)).

When some one ask me "What is the best programming language for beginners?" I say **JavaScript**. Why?...

#### [It's Easy to Start](#easy-to-start) 
Is somewhat easy to get started with as it is a higher level language. Javascript is comparatively easy to learn than other programming languages, provided you learn properly. You don't need to setup any development environment, you can get started with coding JavaScript straight from your browser. 

#### [Most Popular Programming Language](#most-popular-lang)
Itâ€™s the most used and popular programming language nowadays. BIG community that is up for helping you out. 
According to [Strackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) report JavaScript is on top of the list **Programming Languages to Learn in 2018**.

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="9a27196d-d807-4699-ab6b-d16265d08a2a" data-type="interactive" data-title=""></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

#### [Fun](#fun-lang) 
JavaScript mostly used for frontend development and you can immediately see results of your work in browser (further I will show you how to code "in realtime"). There are various tools that will allow you to quickly get a working prototype with JavaScript. You can make HTML5 and Javascript games like [browser quest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/) or [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).
